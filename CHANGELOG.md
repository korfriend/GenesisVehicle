# Changelog — genesis_vehicle

All notable changes are documented here. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (major.minor.patch).

`__version__` lives in `genesis_vehicle/_version.py` and is re-exported as
`genesis_vehicle.__version__` plus the `version()` / `version_info()`
functions. `VehiclePhysics.__init__` prints a one-line banner with the
running version the first time it is instantiated in a process.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-05-18

### Added
- `genesis_vehicle.scene_helpers` module with two thin Genesis-side
  convenience helpers:
  - `make_wheel_raycaster(scene, entity, urdf_path, ...)` — replaces the
    five-line `parse_urdf` + `WheelRayPattern` + `gs.sensors.Raycaster` +
    `scene.add_sensor` boilerplate with one call.
  - `add_vehicle(scene, urdf_path, preset_fn=None, ...)` — adds the URDF
    entity + raycaster (and optionally builds the preset `VehicleConfig`)
    in one call. Returns `(car, sensor, cfg)`. Caller still owns
    `scene.build()` and `VehiclePhysics(...)` construction so other
    entities / sensors can be added between.
- Both are lazy-imported through the top-level package, so
  `from genesis_vehicle import add_vehicle` works without Genesis
  installed at import time.

### Design note
The SDK intentionally does NOT fully encapsulate Genesis. Helpers cut the
canonical boilerplate for the common case; full-encapsulation facades for
CARLA-style or Gym-style use will live under `genesis_vehicle.adapters/`
when needed. This keeps the core API research-friendly (viewer, terrain,
custom materials, multi-agent scenes all stay accessible) while still
offering a one-liner for the common path.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-17

### Added
- `car_4w_fwd_ackermann` preset — 4-wheel front-wheel-drive car with front Ackermann steering. Fills the obvious gap between the existing `car_4w_rwd_ackermann` and `car_4w_awd_ackermann` presets (real-world passenger cars are mostly FWD). Mirrors the RWD preset's parameters with `FWD(driven_axles=(0,))`.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-17

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **Stability profile renamed**: `"physical"` → `"raw"`. No deprecated alias kept.
  - **Reason for break.** The original `"physical"` name implied "the physically correct config" or "the right profile for parameter fitting", which is incorrect. Fitted parameters in this SDK are always model-coupled (Pacejka `B` is the coefficient that fits real inside our SDK; it is not "rubber's true stiffness"). Hooks are part of the model. The right Real2Sim rule is *"fit with the same profile you'll deploy with"* — for our SDK that is almost always `"control"`. The renamed `"raw"` profile is now correctly framed: hook-free raw dynamics for **debugging / ablation**, not a general fitting recommendation.
  - **No alias kept.** Pre-1.0 versioning + essentially no external users; keeping the misleading name even as a deprecated alias would perpetuate the confusion the rename is meant to resolve.
- API.md S6 rewritten around "one rule: fitting forward model = deployment forward model", with `"raw"` reframed as an analysis tool rather than a Real2Sim recommendation.

### Migration
- Replace every `stability="physical"` with `stability="raw"` (or, more likely, with the default `"control"`, since most users were on `"physical"` because the doc misled them).
- If you were on `"physical"` for Real2Sim fitting and plan to deploy with `"control"`, **change fitting to `"control"`** so the forward models match.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Stability profile** on every preset: `stability="control" | "physical" | "research"` (default `"control"`).
  - `"control"` — RL/MPPI-friendly hooks: `RollingResistance` + `LowSpeedRegularizer(disable_when_control_active=False)` (+ `StaticFrictionLock` for tank). Default for `car_4w_rwd_ackermann`, `car_4w_awd_ackermann`, `truck_6w_partial_ackermann`, `tank_10w_skid_belt`.
  - `"physical"` — empty hook list. Use for Real2Sim parameter identification so numerical stabilizers don't leak into fitted parameters.
  - `"research"` — empty hook list. Caller assembles hooks manually.
- `stability_hooks_for_profile(profile, vehicle_kind)` public helper to materialize the same hook lists used by the presets.
- Version API: `__version__`, `VERSION_INFO`, `version()`, `version_info()` exported from `genesis_vehicle`.
- One-time version banner printed on first `VehiclePhysics` initialization:
  ```
  [genesis_vehicle v0.3.0] Initialized: 4 wheels, Ackermann, RWD, Independent, n_envs=1, hooks=[RollingResistance, LowSpeedRegularizer]
  ```
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) tracking version history.

### Changed
- **Footgun fix** — `"control"` profile builds `LowSpeedRegularizer` with `disable_when_control_active=False`. The legacy default (`True`) made the regularizer a no-op exactly when MPPI was applying throttle, so the documented "low-speed stabilization" never fired under control. Direct construction (`LowSpeedRegularizer()`) keeps the legacy default for backwards compatibility.

### Notes
- The hook system is now treated as a stability profile rather than a free-form list assembled by the user. This aligns with industry vehicle SDKs (PhysX sticky tire mode, Jolt anti-rollback, Chaos low-speed threshold, Unity WheelCollider stick-slip) where low-speed numerical stabilization is part of the model, not an opt-in plug-in. Advanced users can still pass `stability="research"` and assemble `cfg.stability_hooks` manually.

## [0.2.0]

Reviewer-driven revisions of the v0.1.0 reference implementation. The SDK's
public contracts and helper boundaries were tightened ahead of the first
variant migration.

### Added
- `genesis_vehicle/dynamics.py` — pure-Python primitives:
  - `brake_torque_signed(t_brake, omega, smoothing_scale=0.5)` — positive brake magnitude → signed torque opposing wheel rotation.
  - `suspension_normal_force(compression, comp_rate, k_susp, c_compression, c_extension, air_mask)` — asymmetric damper + non-negative clamp + air-mask zero in one call.
- `VehicleStepInputs` typing alias on `VehiclePhysics.step()` (Union of `VehicleInputs` + every typed input).
- `estimate_spin_inertia_from_genesis(entity, link_name, spin_axis_local=None)` with optional axis projection (`a^T diag(I) a`).
- New tests:
  - `tests/test_dynamics.py` (8 tests) for `brake_torque_signed` and `suspension_normal_force`.
  - `tests/test_config_resolve.py::test_user_explicit_i_wheel_wins_over_urdf`, `test_user_explicit_radius_wins_over_urdf`.

### Changed
- **`i_wheel` truth policy** — `WheelConfig.i_wheel` set by the user (or populated by URDF) is now authoritative; the Genesis-runtime spin-inertia refinement only fires for wheels where neither the user nor the URDF supplied a value. Previously the Genesis estimate always overrode.
- **Inertia helper renamed**: `parse_inertia_max_principal_genesis` → `estimate_spin_inertia_from_genesis`. The old name is kept as a deprecated alias and will be removed in a later release.
- `core.py` refactored to call the new `dynamics.py` helpers instead of inlining the brake/suspension formulas.
- `__init__.py` exposes the full public surface (strategies, tire models, presets) as a single import path: `from genesis_vehicle import ...`.

### Documentation
- API.md restructured into 11 sections; new "Physics contracts" section codifies brake-sign, non-negative N, `i_wheel` policy, ISO 8855 steer convention, and coupling order. Migration cheatsheet now uses the "URDF default, API override wins" wording instead of the misleading "URDF as truth".

---

## [0.1.0]

Initial Phase 3 reference implementation of the genesis_vehicle SDK.

### Added
- Top-level `VehiclePhysics` driver running the shared 5-step ray-wheel pipeline batched over `n_envs ≥ 1`.
- Strategy abstractions: `SteeringStrategy` (`Ackermann`, `PartialAckermann`, `SkidSteer`, `NoSteer`), `DrivetrainStrategy` (`FWD`, `RWD`, `AWD`, `PerSide`), `CouplingStrategy` (`Independent`, `SameSideBelt`), `StabilityHook` (`RollingResistance`, `LowSpeedRegularizer`, `StaticFrictionLock`).
- Tire models: `PacejkaAnisotropic`, `CoulombIsotropic`.
- Config & merge: `WheelConfig`, `ChassisConfig`, `VehicleConfig`, `ResolvedConfig`, `resolve()`, `ConfigError`. URDF defaults + per-wheel overrides.
- Inputs: unified `VehicleInputs` + typed (`AckermannInputs`, `SkidSteerInputs`, etc.) with `from_unified()` adapters.
- `parse_urdf()` convention-based parser supporting HJW (`*_suspension_joint`) and KDU (`*_susp`) naming.
- Visual layer (`VisualSync`) absorbing URDF axis-sign quirks.
- Presets for four reference vehicles: `car_4w_rwd_ackermann`, `car_4w_awd_ackermann`, `truck_6w_partial_ackermann`, `tank_10w_skid_belt`.
- Pure-Python tests for URDF parsing, config resolve, strategy math.
