# Physics Server (`genesis_vehicle.server`)

An OSC/UDP server that runs the `genesis_vehicle` physics pipeline as a
standalone process and streams vehicle state to an external client (Unreal
Engine, Unity, a custom viewer, …). The client owns rendering and control
input; Genesis owns the physics truth.

> **Do you even need the server?** If your client is Python, you almost
> certainly don't — `import genesis_vehicle` and drive `VehiclePhysics` /
> `MultiVehiclePhysics` directly (simpler, faster, no UDP hop). The server
> exists for **language-agnostic, out-of-process clients** (C++ / C# /
> Blueprint). See [`batching.md`](batching.md) for the in-process APIs.

## 1. Purpose

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Client["Client (UE / Unity)"]
        C1["renders"]
        C2["sends inputs"]
        C3["shows actors"]
    end
    subgraph Server["genesis_vehicle.server"]

        S3["streams transforms"]
    end
    Client -->|"control in (OSC/UDP)"| Server
    Server -->|"state out (OSC/UDP)"| Client
```

The server is **client-agnostic**: any process that speaks the OSC schema
in §4 can drive it. The bundled `genesis_unreal_plugin/` is one such
client (Unreal). UE-specific bits are confined to the wire format (cm /
left-handed coordinate conversion in `osc_manager.py`); the physics core
has no engine dependency.

---

## 2. Running

```bash
# L2 mode (per-entity) — the default: interacting / heterogeneous vehicles, one world
python -m genesis_vehicle.server

# multi-env (L3) mode: many IDENTICAL, NON-interacting vehicles
python -m genesis_vehicle.server --multi-env

# both modes default to the CPU backend; --gpu opts into GPU
# (pays off in --multi-env mode at ~300+ envs — measured crossover, see 2.1)
python -m genesis_vehicle.server --multi-env --gpu

# common flags
python -m genesis_vehicle.server --headless          # no Genesis viewer window
python -m genesis_vehicle.server --recv_port 7001 --send_port 7002 --send_port_obs 7004
# dt: the client-sent dt wins; the server fallback default is 0.025 (40 Hz,
# v1.0.17). To force 40 Hz regardless of what the client sends:
python -m genesis_vehicle.server --override_dt 0.025
# Rationale: verified physics-identical to 0.02 at substeps=2 on bumpy terrain
# (cruise/z-oscillation/yaw within noise), while the per-step budget grows
# 20 → 25 ms (+25 %) and total CPU drops ~20 % (40 loops/s instead of 50).
python -m genesis_vehicle.server --override_dt 0.01  # 100 Hz physics (finer)
python -m genesis_vehicle.server --no-floor --vis_mode visual -v

# pacing: ADAPTIVE catch-up is the default (v1.0.20). The server monitors
# steps/loop: sustained overload (window avg ≥ 1.5) drops the cap to 1 —
# steady, burst-free slow motion; once step-loops run comfortably under the
# dt budget again (a full window of consecutive < 0.9×dt loops) it returns
# to cap=max(5, 0.1/dt) so backlog catch-up / real-time recovery resumes
# (plus a 100-loop startup grace so the build/JIT transient can't trigger it).
# Switches log as [Pacing] [AdaptiveCatchup]; every [STATS] line shows the
# current mode as [cap=N:burst|smooth|fixed:N].
# Pass N to PIN the cap and disable the adaptive pacer:
python -m genesis_vehicle.server --max-catchup-steps 1   # always-smooth (old fixed behavior)

# pacing diagnostics: dump the trigger context on every adaptive switch
# (window steps/loop history, loop_dur avg/p95, dt budget, est speed ratio).
# Off by default; the server benchmark (§2.1) always enables it.
python -m genesis_vehicle.server --pacing-profile
```

**Diagnostics** printed by both modes:
- startup `[MODE] === L2 (per-entity) === / === L3 (multi-env) ===` banner
  (so perf reports are unambiguous about which path ran);
- startup `[PROFILE]` — one-shot per-step section breakdown
  (`raycast/proxy | SDK compute | genesis solver | 기타`), measured over 5
  warmup steps after 2 unprofiled JIT-warm steps;
- runtime `[STATS] [L2|L3 n_envs=N] Loop Avg | Physics Avg
  (X steps/loop, Y ms/step)` every 50 loops. `Physics Avg` is the SUM of the
  loop's catch-up steps — read the per-step value from the parenthesis;
  `steps/loop` pinned at the cap (default 5.0) means the server cannot hold
  real-time (permanent slow-motion), ~1.0 means it can.

## 2.1 Official server benchmark

`genesis_vehicle.server.benchmark` (v1.0.20) drives the REAL server
end-to-end over the OSC wire with a built-in mock UE client — the official
per-mode speed test:

```bash
python -m genesis_vehicle.server.benchmark                  # full matrix:
#   {L2, L3} × {simple(plane), complex(88 convex hulls)} × {1,10,30,100,200,400 tanks}
python -m genesis_vehicle.server.benchmark --modes L3 --tanks 10,30
python -m genesis_vehicle.server.benchmark --terrain complex --gpu   # L3 GPU opt-in
python -m genesis_vehicle.server.benchmark --urdf /path/to/tank.urdf
```

Per configuration it launches the server subprocess (`--headless
--road-raycast-only`, CPU default, dt = 0.025), performs the full OSC
handshake (`/Genesis/Init/Physics` → `/Genesis/Vehicle/Init` (SkidSteer
mapping → `tank_10w_skid_belt`) → K `/Init/Target`s → 88 `/Init/Obstacle`s
(complex) → `/Init/Done`), streams `/Genesis/Vehicle/Control` driving inputs
at ~30 Hz, averages the server's `[STATS]` lines (first dropped as warm-up),
then sends `stop`. The summary table reports ms/step, steps/loop, Loop Avg,
the **pacing mode** (final adaptive-catchup state, with switch count — the
benchmark always runs the server with `--pacing-profile`) and a real-time
verdict (steps/loop ≤ 1.05 AND Loop Avg ≤ 25 ms). Every adaptive-catchup
trigger context is echoed per config as a `[pacing]` line (window steps/loop
history, loop_dur avg/p95, budget, est speed). The tank URDF defaults to
`GeneVehicle_KDU/tank_ray.urdf` next to the repo.

Official reference results (v1.0.20, CPU, dt = 0.025, rco on, WSL2 laptop —
re-run on your hardware for absolute numbers):

GPU backend (`--gpu` — accepted by BOTH server modes; since v1.1.6 the
benchmark forwards it to L2 as well, which is how the L2 anti-scaling below
was measured), same matrix:

| mode | terrain | tanks | ms/step | steps/loop | Loop Avg | pacing | realtime |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L3-GPU | simple | 1 | 13.8 | 0.4 | 8.2 | burst | O |
| L3-GPU | simple | 10 | 15.8 | 0.6 | 14.4 | burst | O |
| L3-GPU | simple | 30 | 14.5 | 0.8 | 19.2 | burst | O |
| L3-GPU | simple | 100 | 15.6 | 1.9 | 57.5 | smooth (1sw) | X |
| L3-GPU | complex(88) | 1 | 19.6 | 2.2 | 60.0 | smooth (1sw) | X |
| L3-GPU | complex(88) | 10 | 18.4 | 1.6 | 40.3 | smooth (1sw) | X |
| L3-GPU | complex(88) | 30 | 19.3 | 2.4 | 67.0 | smooth (1sw) | X |
| L3-GPU | complex(88) | 100 | 21.5 | 2.5 | 91.1 | smooth (1sw) | X |

GPU reading: the physics step barely grows with n_envs (13.8 → 15.6 ms from
1 → 100 tanks — launch-bound, exactly as designed) and reaches CPU parity /
crossover around 100 tanks. The GPU loses on the **serving** side — measured
in steady state (100-simple, smooth cap=1 windows only; the table averages
above mix in pre-switch burst windows, inflating Loop Avg):

| backend | physics ms/step | serving ms/loop | Loop |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPU | 16.2 | 20.3 | 36.5 |
| GPU | 18.2 | 28.5 | 46.7 |

The gap is NOT data volume (tens of KB/loop — µs over PCIe). Every
hypothesis was implemented and measured (v1.1.1–v1.1.3):

1. *"per-read sync count"* — capture now downloads everything with ONE
   on-device concat + `.cpu()` (`_to_host_batched`): Loop unchanged.
2. *"capture-side GPU compute"* — the closed-form wheel poses are now
   computed **on the CPU** from one raw-state download
   (`wheel_visual_transforms_host`; "GPU mode = physics-only on GPU,
   serving math on CPU"): Loop unchanged.
3. *"post-step sync tail"* — the L3 loop's `synchronize()` moved inside the
   physics timing (a measurement fix: ~2 ms of GPU execution tail was being
   booked as serving).

Final steady-state decomposition (100-simple, smooth cap=1 windows): CPU
physics 16.2 / serving ~20.3; GPU physics **21.7** / serving ~25.6. So the
dominant term is **GPU physics itself** (launch-bound — still +5.5 ms over
CPU physics at n_envs=100); the residual serving delta (~5 ms) is per-step
HtoD input uploads + capture getter kernels, within run noise (±3 ms). The
serving-on-CPU architecture is now in place, so at the hundreds-of-envs
scale where GPU physics starts winning, serving will not be the bottleneck.
On complex terrain the extra solver kernel launches additionally cost
~+5 ms/step even at 1 tank.

**GPU crossover (measured, v1.1.6 — simple terrain, ms/step):**

| tanks | L2 CPU | L2 GPU | L3 CPU | L3 GPU |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 30 | 15.7 | 109.5 | 12.1 | 14.5 |
| 100 | 31.1 | **684.0** | 17.4 | 15.6 |
| 200 | 73.2 | (impractical) | 27.4 | 31.5 |
| 400 | — | — | 46.2 | **27.8** |

- **L3 crosses over between 200 and 400 envs**: CPU grows ~linearly
  (17 → 27 → 46 ms) while GPU stays launch-bound-flat (~16–31 ms), so at
  400 envs GPU wins 1.66×. The long-standing "hundreds of envs" guidance
  now has a measured location (~250–300).
- **L2 has NO practical GPU crossover — it anti-scales**: 30 tanks 7×
  slower than CPU, 100 tanks 22× slower (684 ms/step; the GPU build alone
  took >14 minutes). Growing K grows ONE env's system — every per-vehicle
  sensor read and solver stage pays GPU launch/sync latency with no
  env-axis batch width to amortize it. Need interaction at scale → stay on
  CPU; need hundreds of vehicles without interaction → L3 (+`--gpu`
  beyond ~300).

Verdict: **CPU remains the server recommendation for L2 at every size and
for L3 up to ~200–300 envs**; the GPU backend pays off for L3 at ~300+
envs (and for RL/MPPI-style batching driven directly through the SDK).

Reading (CPU): both modes are real-time up to 30 tanks on simple AND complex
terrain. At 100 tanks the adaptive pacer detects the sustained overload and
switches to smooth (steps/loop pinned at 1.0, burst-free slow motion) — L2's
limit is the physics itself (31–36 ms/step, 2 300 links in one env), while
L3's physics still fits the budget (17–25 ms/step) and the loop overrun is
serving overhead (capture + OSC encode for 100 targets), the next
optimization target for 100-vehicle fleets.

## 2.2 Collision-stress benchmark (ring convergence)

The official benchmark spawns tanks on a 15 m grid, so they never touch —
it measures the contact-free cost. `genesis_vehicle.server.benchmark_collision`
(v1.1.1) measures the other regime: K tanks on a circle (radius auto-scaled
from K, `--radius` to override), each facing the center, driven at identical
constant throttle until they all pile up in the middle. L2 only (vehicles
must interact), plane terrain, CPU:

```bash
python -m genesis_vehicle.server.benchmark_collision              # 10, 30 tanks
python -m genesis_vehicle.server.benchmark_collision --tanks 30 --duration 40
python -m genesis_vehicle.server.benchmark_collision --radius 25 --throttle 1.0
```

Unlike `benchmark.py` it also LISTENS on the send port: chassis positions
and yaw are read back from `/Genesis/Vehicle/TargetBulk`, and steering is a
small P-controller aiming every tank at the origin — after the first impact
the tanks stay pressed together (sustained K-way contact) instead of
ricocheting out of the ring. It reports both "speed drops": the physical
one (mean tank speed v_peak → v_end; the collision instant is the first
drop below 50 % of peak) and the simulation one (mean ms/step before vs
after the pile-up, plus the post/pre slowdown factor), with a 0.5 s
timeline of mean ring radius / mean speed / ms/step per config.

Reference results (v1.1.1, CPU, dt = 0.025, throttle 0.8, same WSL2 laptop
as §2.1):

| tanks | R (m) | v_peak → v_end (m/s) | collision t | ms/step pre → post | slowdown |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | 20.0 | 6.29 → 0.02 | 9.5 s | 12.9 → 13.8 | 1.07× |
| 30 | 38.2 | 8.51 → 1.15 | 12.0 s | 14.0 → 19.5 | 1.39× |

Reading: the pile-up is real but affordable. At 30 tanks the sustained
30-way contact scrum costs ~+39 % per step vs the approach phase (peaking
at ~24 ms/step in the densest jam) — still inside the 25 ms real-time
budget that the contact-free grid holds at 15.7 ms/step (§2.1).

**Dependencies** (server only — NOT required by the SDK core):
`pythonosc`, `psutil`, `trimesh` (obstacle-mesh preprocessing). Install
into the same venv as `genesis-world` + `torch`.

**Platform**: Windows and Linux. Windows-only bits (PyInstaller
`ctypes.CDLL` patch, `HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS`) are platform-guarded.

---

## 3. Mode selection

The two server modes are the SDK's L2 / L3 batching axes (see
[`batching.md`](batching.md)); "per-entity" is the historical name of the
L2 mode, kept for the CLI and logs.

| Sample goal | Mode | Batching axis | Backend | Vehicles interact? | Solver |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Interacting traffic, heterogeneous, see collisions | **default (L2)** | **L2** (K vehicles × 1 env) | CPU | ✅ (one world) | batched per vehicle *kind* — identical targets share ONE pipeline (1.0.8) |
| Many identical cars spread out, no mutual collision, max count | **`--multi-env`** | **L3** (1 vehicle × n_envs) | CPU (`--gpu` at ~300+ envs — measured, see §2.1) | ❌ (parallel envs) | 1 × `VehiclePhysics(n_envs=N)` |
| Interacting traffic × N parallel scenarios (RL / MPPI) | *(not in server)* | **L2 × L3** | CPU (GPU at large K×N) | ✅ within env | `MultiVehiclePhysics(n_envs=N)` — drive from Python, see [`samples/l2l3_minimal.py`](../samples/l2l3_minimal.py) |

**Why is CPU the default in BOTH modes?** GPU kernel-launch overhead is a
fixed per-step cost that needs a lot of parallel work to amortize. At
`n_envs=1` (L2) CPU wins outright (measured: 10 vehicles → CPU
47 ms vs GPU 160 ms per step). Even batched (`--multi-env`), the GPU step
is a flat ≈ 19 ms/step (30/50/100 vehicles alike) while the CPU step is
8.4 ms at 30 tanks — so CPU stays ahead until the measured crossover at
~250–300 envs (v1.1.6: L3×400 GPU 27.8 vs CPU 46.2 ms/step — 1.66×), where
the GPU's flat cost finally undercuts the CPU's growing one. Pass `--gpu`
for fleets of that scale. L2 has NO GPU crossover at any size — it
anti-scales (see the crossover table in §2.1). The deciding factor is per-step compute
weight, not vehicle count — for a collision-heavy real map, check the
server's startup `실측된 1스텝 평균` log line and compare. See
[`backends.md`](backends.md) for the consolidated CPU-vs-GPU guide and
[`batching.md`](batching.md) for the full L1/L2/L3 story.

`--multi-env` requirements: all targets share ONE URDF; each target maps
to its own env (`target_id` sorted → env index); dynamic obstacles are
per-env copies (state reported from env 0); `target_forces` and
impulse/torque relative commands are not supported (logged at runtime).

**Raycast scene**: since v1.0.12 BOTH modes default to the SDK's
`dual_scene` raycast (matching `VehicleScene`'s own default) — statics get
a kinematic mirror in a separate raycast scene (static BVH, wheels ride
the exact mesh surface), and dynamic obstacles get a per-step-synced
mirror so wheels can still drive onto moving ramps/platforms.
`--road-raycast-only` composes on top: it additionally drops the
main-scene road collider (no CoACD / chassis-vs-road narrow-phase). The
pre-v1.0.12 L2 behavior — one scene, rays hit the rigid colliders
themselves — remains available as `--single-scene` (L2 mode only;
incompatible with `--road-raycast-only`, ignored by `--multi-env`).

## 4. OSC schema reference

### 4.1 Ports & transport

| Role | Default | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| `recv_port` | 7001 | client → server (all inbound, one unified receiver) |
| `send_port` (`send_port_cpp`) | 7002 | server → client (state, pacing) |
| `send_port_obs` | 7004 | server → client (observation tensors) |

Transport is plain OSC over UDP. The subject name (default `Genesis`)
prefixes some addresses (`/{subject}/…`).

### 4.2 Coordinate convention

Genesis is **right-handed, meters**, quaternion `(w, x, y, z)`. UE is
**left-handed, centimeters**, quaternion `(x, y, z, w)`. Outbound state is
converted in `osc_manager.send_target_states_bulk`:

```
ue_pos  = ( x·100,  −y·100,  z·100 )         # m → cm, Y flipped
ue_quat = ( −qx, qy, −qz, qw )               # (w,x,y,z) → (Qx,Qy,Qz,Qw), mirrored
```

Inbound init poses are expected **already in Genesis coordinates** (the UE
bridge converts on its side before sending).

### 4.3 Handshake (startup)

| Step | Address | Args | Dir |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/Genesis/RequestInit` | — | server → client (polled ~1 Hz until init arrives) |
| 2 | `/Genesis/Init/Physics` | `gravityZ:f, dt:f, friction:f` | client → server |
| 3 | `/Genesis/Vehicle/Init` | `urdfPath:s, mappingJSON:s` | client → server (vehicle only) |
| 4 | `/Init/Target` (or `/{subject}/…`) | `[id:i,] type:i, Px,Py,Pz, Qx,Qy,Qz,Qw, Sx,Sy,Sz, mass:f, friction:f, restitution:f` (14 or 15 args) | client → server |
| 5 | `/Init/Obstacle` | obstacle descriptor (type, pose, scale, mesh path, collision tag) | client → server |
| 6 | `/Init/Done` | — | client → server (ends `wait_for_initialization`) |
| 7 | `/Genesis/Init/Pacing` | `dt:f` | server → client (confirms physics period) |

After build, the server also emits topology once:
`/Genesis/Vehicle/JointList`, `/Genesis/Vehicle/LinkList`,
`/Genesis/Vehicle/WheelNamesList` (arrays of strings).

### 4.4 Runtime — client → server

| Address | Payload | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `/Genesis/Vehicle/Control` | `frameId:i, [id:i, steer:f, throttle:f, brake:f, aux1:f, aux2:f] × K` | per-vehicle inputs (6 fields/vehicle). `steer/throttle/brake` in `[-1,1]`/`[0,1]` |
| `/Genesis/Control` | command string (`stop`, `reset`) | lifecycle |
| `/Genesis/Vehicle/TargetControl/Transform` | `id:i, Px,Py,Pz, Qx,Qy,Qz,Qw` | teleport (pos+quat) |
| `…/TargetControl/Position` · `…/Rotation` | per-component teleport |
| `…/TargetControl/AddLocalOffset` · `AddWorldOffset` | `id:i, dx,dy,dz` | relative move |
| `…/TargetControl/AddLocalRotation` · `AddWorldRotation` | `id:i, qw,qx,qy,qz` | relative rotate |
| `…/TargetControl/AddWorldForce` · `AddWorldImpulse` · `AddWorldTorque` | `id:i, x,y,z` | per-vehicle external wrench (L2 mode only) |
| `/Genesis/Obstacle/Transform` | `id:i, Px,Py,Pz, Qx,Qy,Qz,Qw` | drive a dynamic obstacle from the client |

### 4.5 Runtime — server → client

| Address | Payload | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `/Genesis/Vehicle/TargetBulk` | per vehicle: `id:i, Px,Py,Pz, Qx,Qy,Qz,Qw, numWheels:i, (wPx,wPy,wPz, wQx,wQy,wQz,wQw, spinAngle:f) × numWheels`; trailing `-1` sentinel | all vehicle + wheel transforms, one packet/step |

> **Wheel pose source (v0.7.7+):** the server fills the per-wheel `wPx..wQw`
> from `VehiclePhysics.wheel_visual_transforms("world")` — a closed-form pose
> that already includes steer + suspension + spin and works regardless of
> VisualJointSync (the server runs headless, so VisualJointSync is off). The trailing
> `spinAngle` is therefore sent as `0` (spin is baked into the wheel quat — the
> client uses the quat directly and must NOT re-apply spin). Earlier versions
> read `entity.get_link(wheel)`, which returned a frozen rest pose with
> VisualJointSync off (no suspension travel / no steer). See
> [`api-reference.md`](api-reference.md#76-wheel-visual-pose-for-external-renderers-wheel_visual_transforms-v077).
| `/Genesis/Dynamic/StateBulk` | chunked `id, Px,Py,Pz, Qx,Qy,Qz,Qw` | dynamic obstacle transforms |
| `/Genesis/Init/TimeDilation` | `ratio:f` | tells the client to slow playback when the loop can't hit real-time (`ratio = dt / loop_avg`) |
| `/Genesis/Step/Ack` | `frameId:i` | lockstep acknowledgement |
| `/Genesis/State/Observation` (port 7004) | float array | optional RL observation tensor |

### 4.6 Vehicle mapping JSON (`/Genesis/Vehicle/Init` arg 2)

Serialized from UE's `FGenesisVehicleMapping`. Recognized keys (camelCase
and PascalCase both accepted):

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `driveType` | int | 0 Ackermann, 1 Truck, 2 SkidSteer, 3 Manual — selects a preset for 4w/6w/10w |
| `drivingJoints` / `steeringJoints` | `[{jointName}]` | which joints propel / steer (Manual path) |
| `drivetrainStrategy` | int | 0 AWD, 1 RWD, 2 FWD, 3 PerSide |
| `couplingStrategy` | int | 0 Independent, 1 SameSideBelt |
| `maxTorque` / `maxBrake` | float | drive / brake torque (N·m) |
| `steerScale` *(= `maxSteerRad`)* | float | max steer angle (rad) at \|steer\|=1. **UE serializes `SteerScale`; the server also accepts `maxSteerRad`.** Should stay within the URDF steer joint `<limit>` |
| `brakeBiasFrontRatio` | float | front brake fraction (rest to rear) |
| `wheelOverrides` | `[{wheelName, radius, mass, stiffness, muLong, pbX, …}]` | per-wheel physical / Pacejka overrides (fuzzy name match) |

> **Steering note:** `steerScale` is the **center (bicycle) angle**; with
> Ackermann the inner wheel turns *more*. If a client expects "max angle =
> exact wheel angle," account for the Ackermann inner/outer spread. Keep
> `steerScale` ≤ the URDF steer joint limit or the physics angle will
> exceed what the visual joint can show.

---

## 5. Limitations

- **`--multi-env`**: same-URDF only; no inter-vehicle collision (separate
  envs); dynamic obstacles per-env (env-0 state sent); no per-vehicle
  forces/impulses; no lockstep.
- **L2 × L3 through the server** is not wired (by design) — drive
  `MultiVehiclePhysics(n_envs=N)` from Python instead.
- **UDP datagram size**: ~16 KB at 100 vehicles. Fine on localhost; over a
  real network this can exceed MTU and fragment (one lost fragment drops
  the whole packet). Split per-vehicle if you hit this.

---

## 6. Relationship to `genesis_unreal_plugin/`

The canonical, version-controlled implementation lives **here, in the
SDK** (`genesis_vehicle/server/`). The repository-external
`genesis_unreal_plugin/` folder is a thin launcher that delegates to this
package (run `python -m genesis_vehicle.server` or its shim). Earlier the
plugin kept its own full copy of the server, which led to a silently
dropped performance patch on a hand-off overwrite — do not reintroduce a
fork there; edit the SDK copy.
